NuGetPackageVisualizer
======================

A small tool able to generate a DGML file visualizing your NuGet references.

Using different colors for each package, you will be able to monitor of you are using the most recent version of each package. Green color and you're good. Red and you are not using the recent version of that NuGet package. A yellow color indicates, that you are referencing the same package from different packages.config files, but in different versions.
